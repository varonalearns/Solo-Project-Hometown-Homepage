## Requirements

- Use a different color palette
- Add a Google font
- Find a way to use :hover
- Add a whole new section

## What was learned
In this solo project, I reinforved concepts of classes, flexbox, and background-image. I struggled alot with getting things to fit and noticed that things did not resize like I wanted them to.

## Further development
In the future, I would like to come back to this project and figure out how to make it more dynamic. Perhaps try some of the stretch goals set out for me. I definitely think there are some things to work with here. Just need to learn more.
